####Template for assigning data layers to microgid cells.
####Update the Region, Estuary/Site Code, and StateGrids in the "Specifications" Section 
####Save as new working file then delete lines 1-4.

####Regional Florida MicroGrid Metadata Updates

#
#Use Alt+O to collapse all sections, Alt+Shift+O to expand all sections
#Each section builds upon the previous to add data to the microgrids:
#Data order: Estuary and Sections, Oysters in FL, SHA classifications, Seagrass area
#
#
#.rs.restartR() #Restarts session (good if rerunning after working with other files)
#graphics.off()  # turns off any plots from previous work session
#rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) # clears out environment 
#
#Load require packages (should install missing packages as necessary) - MAKE SURE PACMAN IS INSTALLED AND RUNNING!
if (!require("pacman")) {install.packages("pacman")}

               leaflet, tmap,
